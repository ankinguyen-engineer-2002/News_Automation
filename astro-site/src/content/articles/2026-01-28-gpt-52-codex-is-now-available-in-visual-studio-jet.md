GPT-5.2-Codex is generally available to Copilot Enterprise, Copilot Business, Copilot Pro, and Copilot Pro+.

You’ll now be able to access the model in GitHub Copilot Chat on github.com, GitHub Mobile, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse through the chat model picker (agent, ask, and edit modes). If you do not yet have access, please check again later.

This new model will be available to users in:

- Visual Studio versions 17.14.19 and later, 18.0.0 and later, in all modes: ask, agent.
- GitHub Copilot for JetBrains versions 1.5.61 and later, in all modes: ask, edit, agent.
- GitHub Copilot for Xcode versions 0.45.0 and later in all modes: ask, agent.
- GitHub Copilot for Eclipse versions 0.13.0 and later in all modes: ask, agent.

Copilot Business and Enterprise administrators must opt in by enabling the GPT-5.2-Codex policy in Copilot settings. Once enabled, users in that organization will see **GPT-5.2-Codex** in the model picker.
