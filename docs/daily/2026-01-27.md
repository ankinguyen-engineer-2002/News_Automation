### [Dignified Python: 10 Rules to Improve your LLM Agents Writing Python](https://dagster.io/blog/dignified-python-10-rules-to-improve-your-llm-agents)
*Source: Dagster Blog*

Modern LLMs are trained on an enormous and unruly mix of code: questionable StackOverflow snippets, half-finished projects, and hobbyist repositories. When agents generate code from that background, the results can be fast but unfocused. Even when you don’t fully defer to them, the constant cycle of nudging, correcting, and rewriting can make development feel fragmented rather than cohesive.

### [Dagster + Snowflake: Building Production AI Pipelines with Cortex](https://dagster.io/blog/dagster-snowflake-cortex)
*Source: Dagster Blog*

Snowflake has evolved into an AI compute platform. [Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/cortex/) lets you run sentiment analysis on millions of rows, extract entities from unstructured text, and generate intelligent summaries directly in SQL without moving your data.

### [Pytest for Agent-Generated Code: Concrete Testing Strategies to Put Into Practice](https://dagster.io/blog/pytest-for-agent-generated-code-concrete-testing-strategies-to-put-into-practice)
*Source: Dagster Blog*

In a [previous post](https://dagster.io/blog/dignified-python-10-rules-to-improve-your-llm-agents), we discussed some of the stylistic choices we use internally to ensure that Python code generated by our agents remains “dignified.” These rules, covering style, structure, and idiomatic Python, help us maintain a consistently high-quality codebase even when much of the code is machine-assisted.

### [Trusting AI agents: A reinsurance case study](https://temporal.io/blog/trusting-ai-agents-a-reinsurance-case-study)
*Source: Temporal Blog*

AI agents have the potential to automate tedious tasks such as manual data processing, but they’re inherently non-deterministic and fallible. In the reinsurance industry, where data drives risk modeling and premium pricing, mistakes can have serious financial consequences. And the more tools, agents, and multi-step decision-making involved, the greater the chance of error.

## Data Platform

### [Introducing ADE-bench: measuring how AI agents perform data work](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/ade-bench-dbt-data-benchmarking)
*Source: dbt Labs Blog*

As AI coding agents reshape software engineering, a critical question remains unanswered: how well do these tools actually perform analytics and data engineering work?

### [What makes a great dbt Summit presentation? (And why yours belongs on stage)](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-dbt-summit-presentation)

The call for papers (CFP) for dbt Summit is now open, and we hope to hear from you.

### [Apache Iceberg and the catalog layer](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/apache-iceberg-and-the-catalog-layer)
*Source: dbt Labs Blog*

In this episode of The Analytics Engineering Podcast, Tristan talks with Russell Spitzer, a PMC member of Apache Iceberg and Apache Polaris and principal engineer at Snowflake. They discuss the evolution of open table formats and the catalog layer. They dig into how the Apache Software Foundation operates. And they explore where Iceberg and Polaris are headed. If you want to go deep on the tech behind open table formats, this is the conversation for you.

### [How Sweetgreen transformed unstructured data into conversational analytics with dbt and AI](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/sweetgreen-conversational-analytics-dbt-ai)
*Source: dbt Labs Blog*

Data is supposed to settle debates. But at Sweetgreen, a popular restaurant chain, it would sometimes start them. Stakeholders either didn’t have access to the right insights, or they ran into inconsistencies.

### [Closing the context gap: Cribl’s blueprint for trusted AI with dbt + Omni](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/cribl-dbt-omni-ai-analytics)

Since [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli?utm_source=blog-agentic-wflows-cli-features-cta&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=jan26postuniverse) launched in public preview in September 2025, we’ve been shipping frequent regular updates and advancements.. Below, we’ll show you what makes Copilot CLI so special, why it’s great to have an agentic AI assistant right in your terminal, and how we’re building the Copilot CLI to connect more broadly to the rest of the GitHub Copilot ec...

### [Build an agent into any app with the GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/build-an-agent-into-any-app-with-the-github-copilot-sdk/)
*Source: GitHub Blog*

You have to manage context across turns, orchestrate tools and commands, route between models, integrate MCP servers, and think through permissions, safety boundaries, and failure modes. Even before you reach your actual product logic, you’ve already built a small platform.

### [AI-supported vulnerability triage with the GitHub Security Lab Taskflow Agent](https://github.blog/security/ai-supported-vulnerability-triage-with-the-github-security-lab-taskflow-agent/)
*Source: GitHub Blog*

Triaging security alerts is often very repetitive because false positives are caused by patterns that are obvious to a human auditor but difficult to encode as a formal code pattern. But large language models (LLMs) excel at matching the fuzzy patterns that traditional tools struggle with, so we at the GitHub Security Lab have been experimenting with using them to triage alerts. We are using our recently announced [GitHub Security Lab Taskflow Agent](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/seclab-t...
